# Upload Solution Summary

## 🎯 Your Requirements Met

✅ **Unified Endpoint**: One mutation for both albums and collages  
✅ **PDF Support**: Upload PDF files  
✅ **Image Support**: Upload images (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)  
✅ **UUID-Based**: Files organized by UUID  
✅ **Simplest Approach**: Minimal configuration needed

## 🏗️ What I Built

### 1. **Unified Upload Function**

- **Location**: `amplify/functions/presign-upload/`
- **Purpose**: Generate secure presigned URLs for S3 uploads
- **Features**:
  - Handles both albums and collages
  - Supports PDFs and images
  - File size validation (50MB max)
  - Content type validation
  - 1-hour URL expiry

### 2. **GraphQL Schema**

- **Mutation**: `presignUpload(input: AWSJSON!)`
- **Input**: Type, UUID, filename, content type, file size
- **Output**: Presigned URL, S3 key, expiry info

### 3. **S3 Storage Structure**

```
your-bucket/
├── albums/{uuid}/timestamp_filename.pdf
└── collages/{uuid}/timestamp_filename.pdf
```

## 🚀 Frontend Usage

### Step 1: Get Presigned URL

```javascript
const response = await fetch("your-graphql-endpoint", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      mutation PresignUpload($input: AWSJSON!) {
        presignUpload(input: $input)
      }
    `,
    variables: {
      input: JSON.stringify({
        type: "album", // or "collage"
        uuid: "your-uuid",
        fileName: file.name,
        contentType: file.type,
        fileSize: file.size,
      }),
    },
  }),
});

const uploadData = JSON.parse(response.data.presignUpload);
```

### Step 2: Upload to S3

```javascript
const uploadResponse = await fetch(uploadData.uploadUrl, {
  method: "PUT",
  body: file,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": file.type,
  },
});
```

## 📋 Supported File Types

### Albums & Collages

- **PDFs**: `application/pdf`
- **Images**: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`

## 🔧 Backend Configuration

### Files Created/Modified:

1. ✅ `amplify/functions/presign-upload/handler.ts` - Upload logic
2. ✅ `amplify/functions/presign-upload/resource.ts` - Function definition
3. ✅ `amplify/functions/presign-upload/package.json` - Dependencies
4. ✅ `amplify/backend.ts` - Function registration
5. ✅ `amplify/data/resource.ts` - GraphQL schema
6. ✅ `test-upload.js` - Test script
7. ✅ `FRONTEND_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation

### S3 Storage Already Configured:

- ✅ Bucket permissions for albums/_ and collages/_
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Lifecycle policies

## 🚧 Deployment Status

The upload functionality is **ready to deploy**. The files are created and configured correctly. To deploy:

1. **Deploy the backend**:

   ```bash
   npm run sandbox:once
   ```

2. **Test the upload**:
   ```bash
   node test-upload.js
   ```

## 💡 Key Benefits

1. **Simplest Approach**: One endpoint for everything
2. **Secure**: Presigned URLs with 1-hour expiry
3. **Organized**: Files stored by type and UUID
4. **Validated**: File type and size validation
5. **Frontend-Ready**: Complete JavaScript examples provided

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

Your backend is **fully compatible** with frontend file uploads. The unified endpoint makes it simple to upload both PDFs and images for albums and collages using the same API.

### Next Steps:

1. Deploy the backend (if not already done)
2. Use the frontend code examples
3. Test with your actual files
4. Integrate into your application

The solution handles everything you requested:

- ✅ One endpoint for albums and collages
- ✅ PDF and image uploads
- ✅ UUID-based organization
- ✅ Simplest possible implementation
